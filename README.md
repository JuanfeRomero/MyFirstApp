# MyFirstApp
-My first attemp at developing an app through android studio, using java.

-This app was made following some simple tutorials on google developer codelabs, utilizes the basic functions of the interfaces and teaches how to connect the front end side of the app's layout in xml to the back end side programmed in Java.

-I'll include the whole project and the apk file built from it on this repository.

-This app has 3 buttons which either shows a floating message, adds numbers to a counter and one that goes to a second screen to show a random number between zero and the current number in the counter, it also contains a welcome message that can be edited.
