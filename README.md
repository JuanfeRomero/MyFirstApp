# MyFirstApp
-My first attemp at developing an app through android studio, using java.

-This app was made following some simple tutorials on google developer codelabs, utilizes the basic functions of the interfaces and teaches how to connect the front end side of the app's layout in xml to the back end side programmed in Java.

-I'll include the whole project and the apk file built from it on this repository.

-This app has 3 buttons:
  *Toast: it shows the messages that it's written on the 'hello new app' text box
  *Count: it adds a number to the counter, every time it's tapped it will add 1 more
  *Random: it will show a second screen which will display a random number between 0 and the current number on the counter
